              <h1>Definition of Video games</h1>
              <p>A video game is an interactive form of entertainment that utilizes user interfaces to produce visual feedback on electronic devices. It merges elements of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, creativity, and narrative expression.</p>
              <p>Players engage with video games through controllers, keyboards, mice, or touch screens, manipulating visual elements on the screen. Video games span various genres, offering diverse experiences such as action, adventure, sports, puzzles, simulations, and strategies.</p>

              <h1>Origin of video games</h1>
              <p>Video games emerged in the 1950s following World War II and the development of the first programmable computers. Early video games were primarily experimental programs created by students and researchers for recreational purposes.</p>
              <p>The debate persists over the first person to create a video game, but Alexander S. Douglas is often credited with developing the first interaction program between humans and computers, laying the groundwork for modern video games.</p>

              <h1>Alexander Shafto Douglas</h1>
              <p>Douglas, a native of London, is recognized for pioneering the development of computer-human interaction programs, essentially creating the first video game. His fascination with science led him to pursue education at the University of Cambridge, where he explored the concept of computers interacting with people.</p>
              <p>With the support of the university's resources, Douglas utilized the EDSAC computer to demonstrate his theory by programming a simple game, earning his PhD and validating his ideas.</p>

            <h1>Programs for entertainment</h1>
            <p>The earliest recreational computer programs, dating back to the mid-20th century, focused on games like chess, serving both educational and entertainment purposes. These programs, including Spacewar!, developed in 1961 at MIT, laid the foundation for modern video games, despite lacking commercial intentions.</p>

            <h1>The first video game</h1>
            <p>The 1970s marked the emergence of commercial video games, including computer adaptations of traditional board games like Pong, released by Atari in 1972. Pong's success established the video game industry and set the stage for its exponential growth, shaping modern entertainment culture.</p>
