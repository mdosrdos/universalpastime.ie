          <h1>Pros and Cons</h1>
          <p>In 1972, Atari introduced Pong, the first truly successful commercial 
            arcade video game. Since then, video games have evolved from arcade systems 
            to home consoles, handheld consoles, and mobile devices. Today, video games 
            make up a massive $100 billion global industry.
          </p>
          <p>Video games are often at the forefront of computer technology and 
            they have been a part of our culture since the past few decades. 
            But let’s face it, they have their share of Pros and Cons. Let’s 
            take a further look at the pros and cons of video games.

          <h1>Advantages</h1>
          <p>Even though video games are demonized by most non-players, many 
            scientists and psychologists find that video games can have many 
            benefits. Some of them are explained below.
          </p>
          <h2>Present</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Rich storytelling and immersive experiences can foster creativity and imagination.</li>
            <li>Many educational games are available, facilitating learning in subjects like math, science, and language.</li>
            <li>Online multiplayer games encourage teamwork, communication, and collaboration.</li>
            <li>Games with physical activity components, like motion controls or VR, promote exercise and movement.</li>

          <h1>Advantages</h1>
          <h2>Past</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>May Ease Anxiety and Depression.</li>
                <p>People who feel depressed lack physical energy, find it difficult to carry out daily tasks, and are generally pessimistic. Thus, playing can reduce the risks for depression, help with arthritis, and even be a therapeutic option for aphasia.</p>
                <p>It has been found that people are more confident, energetic, and emotionally positive when they play video games, which is exactly the opposite of what depression brings about.</p>           
            <li>Promoted social interaction among peers when playing together.</li>
                <p>Video games involve taking risks and the ability to strategize. They teach patience, perseverance, and the right judgment. They also help people find new friends and social connections. Besides, gamers become better at critical analysis and learn to concentrate on tasks at hand to completion.</p>
            <li>Improved Hand-eye Coordination and Reaction Times</li>
                <p>Playing video games directly impacts regions of the brain responsible for memory, spatial orientation, information organizations, and fine motor skills.</p>
            <li>Enhanced Problem-solving and Decision-making Skills</li>
                <p>It could improve decision-making skills; compared to non-players, gamers who spend time daily with fast-paced games can react to questions or situations up to 25% faster.</p>

          <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
          <h2>Present</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Excessive gaming could lead to social isolation and sedentary lifestyles.</li>
              <p>Video games often act as a replacement for real-time human connections. People who find themselves playing hours upon hours of video games may find themselves losing touch with the relationships they’ve built with other people.</p>
              <p>People argue that with internet-connected games, they can easily hang out with friends and families without ever leaving home, but this type of virtual get together is no replacement for actual face-to-face interaction.</p>
            <li>Some games were criticized for promoting violence and aggressive behavior.</li>
              	<p>Often, children playing violent video games depict a lack of self-control and an increase in emotional arousal. While violent video games could have different effects on different people, they are all concerning. So, it is better to choose games you feel are appropriate for both you and your children.</p>
            <li>Limited access to educational content compared to modern educational games.</li>
              <p>Although video games can improve the strategic thinking decision-making process, they can also deteriorate them.</p>
              <p>Students who use their free time to play video games can struggle to keep up with school/college. Most gamers have been seen to procrastinate on their studying, or they simply ignore a deadline just to play their favorite game.</p>
            <li>Concerns about addiction and excessive screen time.</li>
              <p>Video games are designed to be addictive, so it is essential to have some self-control. Especially people with poor impulse control or who have a hard time fitting in are most vulnerable to game addiction.</p>
              <p>It could be because people tend to play games to fill the void that real-world problems leave behind. It is better to watch out for this form of addiction because it might eventually end up costing you a lot.</p>

            you have got to win the game of life.
